                    . I am very glad that you are here now and can get to know
                    me better. My path as a programmer began three years ago.
                    After a few months I did an internship as a webmaster and
                    have not stopped since then{" "}

                    </span>
                    . It&apos;s been three years since I had the opportunity to
                    work with great people, learn every day, mostly always, and
                    make great friendships. Currently, I continue to seek new
                    skills, learn and share my humble knowledge as much as
                    possible.

                    I strive to contribute to the success of the team hard work,
                    attention to detail, and excellent organizational skills. A
                    clear of the stack of network protocols and technologies
                    that I own. Motivated to learn, grow, and succeed in IT.
                    I&apos;m interested in the best practices for organizing
                    code, and I have a goal and desire to become an architect in
                    my field.
